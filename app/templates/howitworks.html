<h2>Frequently asked questions </h2>

<h3>When and why did Google build Person Finder?</h3>
Google engineers built Person Finder in response to the January 2010 Haiti earthquake in order to 
help those impacted by the earthquake connect with their loved ones. In the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina, multiple websites created similar tools but did not join their data together, forcing 
families and aid workers to keep track of many similar tools across different websites when looking 
for information. Person Finder solves this problem by serving as a common back-end to store data. 
It implements a common format (PFIF) for transmitting this data that was established by Katrina 
volunteers. Person Finder was bult by a team of Googlers from 5 Google offices in 4 countries who 
launched Person Finder just 52 hours after the Haiti Earthquake. This team was 20%, which means 
that they were volunteers who took time away from their main projects to assist with this effort.
<br><br>
<h3>What impact has Person Finder had to date?</h3>
Righ now, we can measure the impact of the product in terms of usage and customer stories. In 
Chile, for example, of the 77K records, there were 78K notes attached. 63.5% of the records had a 
note attached. 25% of those had a status with 24% of the status being alive. We've also received 
numerous email with anecdotes of people who located friends and loved ones using Person Finder.
<br><br>
<h3>How does Google.org decide whether or not to launch Person Finder in response to a disaster?</h3>
Person Finder is one piece of <a href=http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/ title="{% trans 'Google Crisis response' %}">Google Crisis Response</a>. 
Googe Crisis Response analyzes the scale of the disaster and the available technology in the region, 
and then determines which of its tools would be most useful for responding to the given situation.
<br><br>
<h3>Who has access to the Person Finder data?</h3>
Data entered into Person Finder is available to the public and viewable and usable by anyone. 
Google does not review or verify the accuracy of this data. The standard <a href=http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS title="{% trans 'Google terms of service' %}">Google Terms of Service</a> 
apply to all users of Person Finder.
<br><br>
<h3>How does Google keep Person Finder records up-to-date?</h3>
Person Finder depends on individual users to update and remove records when no longer relevant. 
Google is not responsible for updating the data.
<br><br>
<h3>How does Google validate the accuracy of information before allowing people to post?</h3>
All data entered into Person Finder is available to the public and viewable and usable by anyone. 
We are unable to systematically validate the accuracy of the information at the time it's posted. 
Person Finder is largely valuable for the immediacy by which people can find and post information. 
That does mean that people will sometimes post incorrect information. We continue to do our best to 
remove such posts when flagged. We don't want to publish or keep this information longer than is 
necessary. When you enter a new record in Google Person Finder, you can specify when you want it to 
expire. It will automatically disappear from Google Person Finder at that time, and it will be gone 
from our backups within 60 days thereafter.
<br><br>
<h3>Is there sometime that I can do to help as a person with local knowledge?</h3>
If you have information about a person, make sure to update Person Finder.
<br><br>
<h3>How does Person Finder use crowd-sourcing?</h3>
We're at an early stage of understanding how best to utilize crowd sourced and verified 
information, but it is a powerful source of information. With Person Finder we have numerous 
anecdotes and data on usage to show this has been helpful.
